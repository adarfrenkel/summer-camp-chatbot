At GenAi Summer Camp, we prioritize instilling positive values and fostering personal growth among our campers. Our camp ethos is centered on three core principles: inclusivity, respect, and a growth mindset. We believe that creating a welcoming and accepting environment allows campers to form meaningful connections with one another and discover their ability to overcome challenges. By embracing these values, we cultivate individuals who value diversity, appreciate different perspectives, and approach setbacks as opportunities for growth.

Campers are expected to treat their fellow campers and staff with kindness, respect, and empathy. Our trained counselors will monitor behavior and intervene when necessary to address any issues that may arise, focusing on conflict resolution and fostering a positive camp culture.

Behavior Expectations:
As part of the GenAi Summer Camp community, campers are expected to follow guidelines that encourage responsibility and cooperation. These guidelines include arrival and departure procedures, participation in activities and workshops, adherence to camp schedules, and respectful conduct towards fellow campers, staff, and the campgrounds. Encouraging open communication and setting appropriate boundaries allows campers to feel a sense of ownership and belonging during their camp experience.

Cancellation Policy:
We understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, leading to the cancellation of a camper's reservation. GenAi Summer Camp has a fair cancellation policy in place. If a cancellation is made prior to the designated deadline, a full refund will be provided. However, cancellations made after this deadline may result in a partial refund, depending on the circumstances. We value open communication and encourage campers and their families to reach out to us in case of cancellation or change of plans.

GenAi Summer Camp is strategically situated in a real-world inspired location that offers stunning natural beauty, diverse landscapes, and ample opportunities for outdoor adventures. Nestled in the heart of a serene forest, our campgrounds provide a tranquil setting for campers to reconnect with nature while embarking on exciting activities. The location provides a safe and secure environment, away from the distractions of city life, allowing campers to fully immerse themselves in the summer camp experience.

Real-World Inspired:
The GenAi Summer Camp experience goes beyond the campgrounds, incorporating real-world inspired elements into activities and workshops. We aim to give campers a taste of what they can achieve and experience beyond the camp's boundaries. This may include visits to local universities, industry professionals giving firsthand accounts of their careers, and field trips to nearby landmarks or historical sites. By blurring the lines between the camp and the real world, campers develop a sense of aspiration and broader perspective.

GenAi Summer Camp runs for a duration of four weeks, providing campers with a comprehensive experience that encompasses a broad range of activities, workshops, and courses. The camp begins in early July and concludes in early August, aligning with the traditional summer break period for students. This time frame allows campers to fully immerse themselves in the camp experience while still leaving them with sufficient time to rejuvenate before the start of the new school year.
